          <p>
            Etsy is a global online marketplace, where people come together to
            make, sell, buy, and collect unique items. We're also a community
            pushing for positive change for small businesses, people, and the
            planet. Here are some of the ways we're making a positive impact,
            together.

          <h2>Support independent Creators</h2>
          <p>
            There's no Etsy warehouse â€“ just millions of people selling the
            things they love. We make the whole process easy, helping you connect
            directly with makers to find something extraordinary.
